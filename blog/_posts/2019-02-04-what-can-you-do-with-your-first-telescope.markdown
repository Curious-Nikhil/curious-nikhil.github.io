Twenty-second century, really brought the best of humans, in form of revolution in the field of physics, biology and chemistry. Right now, technology is integrated at every level in our lives. That very fact is the reason why it’s intimidating to think of using a telescope. You can Google images of Galaxies, and chances are the images which you are seeing are taken by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope and surely will be breathe taking!

Hubble is a really powerful telescope. Impossible to get these images from your average consumer telescope!

Of course, you won’t be able to get this level of detail, colour accuracy and magnification on your 100$ Telescope. Hubble’s beautiful space pictures were the driving force, that made me get into astronomy. But soon, I realized the limitations of my device. It’s very essential to note that it’s the experience that actually counts. I had fun star gazing, looking at the heavens, figuring out constellations, tracking planets, waking up at night, to get that perfect atmospheric condition, half sleep- half awake, tinkering those knobs very carefully, with my breath hold tight. All of that, so that I can see the rings of Saturn, which is 1.2 billion kilometres away. This is human instinct at it’s finest! It’s difficult, to contemplate the degree of emotion that it takes, while this event unfolds, the beautiful ringed yellow — planet, slightly shivering due to atmospheric aberration. I will never forget this moment when for the first time I saw planet Saturn with my naked eyes(aided). This experience can’t be traded off with Google images. There is something religious about working hard, just Harry dug out Dobby’s deathbed without using magic. I think inspire of being a muggle, I find that really satisfying!

I always wanted a telescope. Looking at pictures of Hubble, I was definitely inspired to get one.I went out researching every single thing about telescopes for months, on the internet, via Reddit and others.Reddit is where I actually made my decision.
Celestron Powerseeker 60AZ might not be the best telescope, but for beginners it’s great. You can see planets and cluster and even few bright galaxies. There are so many negatives of using this specific model of telescope, but going out, sitting under the dark sky, when in this day and age everyone is busy staring screens, is a one of a kind experience. We are so busy, we really have forgotten to look and change our beautiful night sky. Stargazing is my favorite thing to procrastinate. I still, remember those cold, silent-peaceful night outs. I think at a beginner level, the experience is what matters, more than the device(when you don’t have another option..)
